# READ ME 
This is a project from 2022, where I was gaining experience with OO-programming, as well as software analysis, design and architecture during my bachelor in Computer Science at The University of Copenhagen.

# How to run:
From the root directory, enter "dotnet run" and a simulation will start.

Play around with the code and make your own simulation inside Program.cs!
