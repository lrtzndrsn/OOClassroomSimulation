# READ ME 
This is a project from 2022, where I was learning OO-programmin as well as OO-analysis and design during my bachelor in Computer Science at The University of Copenhagen.

# How to run:
From the root directory, enter "dotnet run" and a simulation will start.

Play around with the code and make your own simulation inside Program.cs!
